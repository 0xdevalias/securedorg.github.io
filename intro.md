# Introduction #

# Reverse Engineering #

"is the processes of extracting knowledge or design information from anything man-made and re-producing it or re-producing anything based on the extracted information"

## What does it mean to be a reverse engineer? ##

## You can ##

* Take things apart to figure out how it works

* Love puzzle solving

* Develop experiments and tools

* Think outside the box

* Constantly learn new things

## Game Plan ##

* Determine what are the goals
  * Get to just what you need, or
  * Know enough to recreate it

* Use reconnaissance and triage skills to determine a target starting point

* Work step by step to get to your goals

* Record your findings through the analysis


## Analysis Flow for Malware Analysis ##

* Setup a baseline** analysis environment

* Triage to determine a starting point

* Static Analysis - Get a sense of where everything is before debugging

* Dynamic Analysis - Determine behaviors that canâ€™t be understood by static analysis

* Manual Debugging - Stepping through the program to navigate to your goals
