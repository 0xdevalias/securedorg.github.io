# Section 1.2: Fundamentals #

## Anatomy of a Windows PE C program ##

Typical windows programs are in the Portable Executable (PE) Format. It’s portable because it contains information, resources, and references to dynamic-linked libraries (DLL) that allows windows to load and execute the machine code.

## Windows Architecture ##

In this workshop we will be focusing on user-mode applications.

### User-mode vs. Kernel Mode [[1]][1] ###

- In user-mode, an application starts a user-mode process which comes with its own private virtual address space and handle table

- In kernel mode, applications share virtual address space.

This diagram shows the relationship of application components for user-mode and kernel-mode.

## PE Header ##

The PE header provides information to operating system on how to map the file into memory.
The executable code has designated regions that require a different memory protection (RWX)
- Read
- Write
- Execute

This diagram shows how this header is broken up.

Here is a hexcode dump of a PE header we will be working with.

## Memory Layout ##

- **Stack** - region of memory is added or removed using “last-in-first-out” (LIFO) procedure [[2]][2]
- **Heap** - region for dynamic memory allocation [[3]][3]
- **Program Image** - The PE executable code placed into memory
- **DLLs** - Loaded DLL images that are referenced by the PE
- **TEB** - Thread Environment Block stores information about the current running thread(s) [[4]][4]
- **PEB** - Process Environment Block stores information about loaded modules and processes. [[5]][5]

This diagram illustrates how the PE is placed into memory.

## The Stack ##

- Data is either pushed onto or popped off of the stack data structure
- **EBP** - Base Pointer is the register that used to store the references in the stack frame

This diagram represents a typical stack frame.
