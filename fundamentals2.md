# Section 1.2: Fundamentals #

## Anatomy of a Windows PE C program ##

Typical windows programs are in the Portable Executable (PE) Format. Itâ€™s portable because it contains information, resources, and references to dynamic-linked libraries (DLL) that allows windows to load and execute the machine code.

## Windows Architecture ##

In this workshop we will be focusing on user-mode applications.

### User-mode vs. Kernel Mode [1] ###

- In user-mode, an application starts a user-mode process which comes with its own private virtual address space and handle table

- In kernel mode, applications share virtual address space.

This diagram shows the relationship of application components for user-mode and kernel-mode.

## PE Header ##

The PE header provides the information to operating system on how to map the file into memory.
The executable code has designated regions that require a different memory protection (RWX)
- Read
- Write
- Execute

This diagram shows how this header is broken up.
